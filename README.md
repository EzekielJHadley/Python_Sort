This is my first real attempt at Python. The goal is to practice both Python and Algorithm design.
As of 8/18/2014 this only contains Quicksort, Mergesort, and Heapsort as functions.
They are all quick and dirty as of now, no optimization. In the future I wish to write them a little neater
and more efficient. I will also convert this into a class with just sorting methods to practice Python's
object oriented abilities.
